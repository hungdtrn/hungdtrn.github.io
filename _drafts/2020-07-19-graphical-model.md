1. Why
- For learnining about representation learning: VAE, GAN, ...
2. How
- Read chapter 8 in pattern recognition and machine learning. 
- Find reference in Probabilistic Graphical Model
3. Output
- Write at least one blog about graphical model


1. What is a graphical model?
    - A graph contains nodes (vertices) connected by edges (or links or arcs).
    - A graphical model is a graph, where each node represent a random variable, each edge express probabilistic relationships between variables
    - The joint distribution of these variables are represented by a graph.
    - Why graphical model?
        - Better representation of 
3. Conditional Independence
    - 3 rules
    - D-separtion
    - Independence map
    - Why D-map and I-map?
4. Directed and Un-directed graph
