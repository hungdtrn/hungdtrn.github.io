Observe some nodes in the graph. Find the posterior distribution on one or more subset of other nodes

Why graph? => More efficient

1. Markov Chain (Inference on Chain)
- Reorder the marginal distribution
- Message passing
    - Forward and backward message of chain
    - Recurrence of the message
- How much efficient?
