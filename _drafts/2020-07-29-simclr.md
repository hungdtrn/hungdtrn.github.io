1. There are two type of visual representational learning
    - Generative: Learn to generate or model pixels in input space (VAE)
    - Discriminative: Learn using objective funciton similar to supervised learning.
        - No label 
        - Both input and target are derieved from unlabel dataset


2. SimCLR
    - Main idea: 
        - Maximize the agreement between different augmented views of the same data. 
        - The agreement is computed in the latent space 
        - Compute loss between the positive pair

    - Research question: What kind of data augmentation, or what composition of data augmentation, is suitable for contrastive learning
        - Spatial Geometric Transformation
        - Appearance transformation 
        - Experiment settings
        - Table results
        - Cropping is good:
            - Give global and local views
            - Give adjacent views
        - Cropping alone is not enough
            - Most patches from different images share the same color distribution

    - Why using a projection head:
        - The loss force the model to learn a representation that is invariant to transformation -> decrease representation capacity
        - Use non-linear projection head, g will do that task. More information will be retained in h
        - Experiments

    - Larger batch size and longer training time
        - Why? 
            - More hard-negative samples
        - Results
        - Compare with supervised learning

3. BYOL
    - Question: Can we learn good representation without using negative samples?
        - What's wrong with negative samples?
    
    - Approach: 
        - Only use different views of the same image
        - Two network: Online and target network
            - The learned representation of the two networks are predictive of each other
        - Collapse representation:
            - The networks alway output zeros
            - => The target network is the slow moving average of the online network
